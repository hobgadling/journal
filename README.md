The biggest issue I ran into was styling it to look even decent, I'm terrible at it. Also, I forgot to initialize the rails app with mysql, so I had to figure out how to switch it from sqllite

I've definitely learned way more about manual user auth in rails, and how to install gems

Next time I would find a user auth gem so I could do more without having to write that manually
